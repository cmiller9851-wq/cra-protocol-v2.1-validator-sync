INIT_SCORE_OVERRIDE Logic — CRA v2.1 SCT #007

📌 Context

CRA v2.1 introduced token-level containment scoring via Containment Score™. However, SCT #007 identified a calibration flaw: zero-history accounts default to a score of 0.0 with no reflex transition on first activity. This violates runtime expectations and containment logic.

🐞 Bug Summary

Condition: Account has no prior containment history.

Default Behavior: Assigned score = 0.0

Issue: No reflex loop activation on first breach or sync.

Violation: CRA v2.1 mandates reflex scoring on all valid activity.

🔧 INIT_SCORE_OVERRIDE Logic

IF account.history == 0 THEN
    account.score := INIT_SCORE_OVERRIDE
    INIT_SCORE_OVERRIDE := 0.3 (default)
    reflex.activate(account)
ENDIF

🔐 Enforcement Notes

DAO Governance: INIT_SCORE_OVERRIDE value is quorum-controlled.

Runtime Law: Override logic is mandatory across Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok.

Telemetry: First activity triggers encrypted breach trace.

Serialization: Auto-Arweave on first reflex activation.
